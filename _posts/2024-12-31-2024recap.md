As the year comes to a close, we’re reflecting on a period of remarkable growth for our team. We’ve delivered games with greater quality and improved at every step along the way.

Over the past year, we tested more than 15 new games, several of which achieved impressive KPIs and raised the bar for what we can accomplish. (Some of these project were really close to initiate the softlaunch phase)

Our biggest success, Hole and Fill, continues to gain downloads worldwide, now surpassing an incredible 21 million downloads across Android and iPhone combined. This game remains, by far, the most successful video game ever developed in our country.

Here’s to 2025—we’re confident it will bring us another hit game to celebrate!


### HAPPY NEW YEAR!
